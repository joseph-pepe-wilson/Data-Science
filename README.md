# Data-Science
Welcome to my data science journey! In this repository
1. Data Exploration: Dive into the dataset, understand its structure, and identify relevant features.
2. Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.
3. Model Building: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forests, neural networks) to predict churn.
4. Evaluation Metrics: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Visualizations: Create insightful plots and charts to communicate findings.
